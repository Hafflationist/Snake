# Snake
Java Snake Project

The goal of this project was to develop a simple game using java to get more familiar with the java language in general and
the Swing and Graphics packages in particular. 

There are still some improvements that need to be implemented, but the game is up and running. Feel free to take a closer look 
at the project.

Cheers
